I’m a Computer Science graduate from VIT University. I have an immense interest in the field of cybersecurity. Most of the knowledge I obtained in this field is powered by the internet. We’re living in a digital world where data has become more valuable than ever. Data in the 21st century is like Oil in the 18th century, an immense valuable asset. With the rapid advancement in technology, cyber-crimes have also increased and hence protection and privacy of data has become an important issue. I believe that with a deeper understanding in the field of security and cryptography, we can provide solutions for this problem.

Apart from my professional passion, I'm a people's person. I enjoy working in teams and am good at managing teams, especially those with heterogeneous members. I believe that a combination of technical expertise and people skills projected in the right direction can always guarantee success. I am a self-driven person with established goals and plans to achieve them. I have always been success oriented, and I will always work towards achieving more.
